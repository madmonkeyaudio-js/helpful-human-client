## Opening

Be sure to npm install dependencies before loading.

## My Implementation

There were a couple revisions I made during the process. My initial thought was to create single pages that (when page number is clicked) would call on the app's state to change the colors. I then realized how annoyed I get when I can't scroll through a list, so I populated a div with all the colors which I could both scroll through and paginate through. 

Once I had populated the content div I set about to make links with react-scroll, but that proved cumbersome and I stuck with a tags instead. Given more time I would figure out a way to paginate the colors on a smooth scroll. 

## Bugs

If you are in the swatch detail view and then click on "Random Color" in left navigation nothing happens, and error 'prop length undefined' is thrown. As a first attempt to fix this, I'd start with switching the view at that point back to the general content page and adjust how random color button processed props. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
